##  Data Engineering Defined
- book definition of data engineering:
	- the **development**, **implementation**, and **maintenance** of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. 
	- **intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering**
	- data engineer manages the **data engineering lifecycle**, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning

### Data engineering lifecycle
- stages of data engineering lifecycle:
	- generation > storage > ingestion > transformation > serving
